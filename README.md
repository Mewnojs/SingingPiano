### Troubleshooting

## Playing generated MIDI files 
* PFA is recommended as it provides a simple choice to customize track colors;
* A MIDI Driver such as [OmniMIDI](https://github.com/KeppySoftware/OmniMIDI) is needed in order to apply the specified [soundfont](/utils/Sine_MNJS_N1_50ms.sf2) before playing;

Suggested Track Color:
(Color #4 is a color close to the background color the most)
| Track # | Color |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0    | Color #4    |
| 1    | Color #3    |
| 2    | Color #2    |
| 3    | Color #1    |
| 4    | Color #1    |
| 5    | Color #2    |
| 6    | Color #3    |
| 7    | Color #4    |
